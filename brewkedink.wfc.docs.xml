             The <see cref="T:BrewedInk.WFC.WFCProgress"/> class represents a unit of progress in the WFC algorithm. As the algorithm is run, a sequence of WCFProgress items will be returned.
             Different types of progress will be returned, and you can switch on the type to gain insights to the algorithm's decisions...

            A WFCError instance could be returned by the WFC algorithm. If you receive one of these instances, it means something with the process has broken.

             In the WFC algorithm, a Slot is a place that holds one <see cref="T:BrewedInk.WFC.Module"/>. As the Wave Function is being collapsed, the slot may have many potential modules available to it.
             As the collapse continues, modules are removed as possibilities from the slot, until there is only one module possible for the slot.

            <summary>
            A SlotEdge is the connection between two slots. In a simple 2D 1X2 grid case, there are two slots, and one slot edge connecting them.
            The term "edge" comes from Graph Theory. These edges are directional.
