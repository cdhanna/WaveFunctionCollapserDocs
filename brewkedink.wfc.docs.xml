             The <see cref="T:BrewedInk.WFC.WFCProgress"/> class represents a unit of progress in the WFC algorithm. As the algorithm is run, a sequence of WCFProgress items will be returned.
             Different types of progress will be returned, and you can switch on the type to gain insights to the algorithm's decisions...
